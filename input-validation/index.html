      <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
      <p>I used a while loop because I did not know how many times the user would take to guess the password, and I wanted it to quit when they guessed correctly.</p>
      <p>That being said, you might want to use a for loop if you only want to give the user so many chances, and then you might use a two-part conditional or a break to get it out of the loop if the correct password is guessed.</p>
      <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
      <p>It does not matter if the password is a string because the prompt returns a string.</p>
