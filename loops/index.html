    <h2>Re-do the previous 4 exercises, but with a for loop instead of a while loop. Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each? Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h2>
    <p>You also need to think about variables.  A while loop changes the variable you are working with.  A count changes a throwaway counter variable.</p>
    <p>If I know how long something is going to increment/decrement, I use a for counter.  If I don't know, I will use a while statement.</p>
