    <h2>
    Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
    <p>Variables are used just like in any programming language - to allow you the flexibility to do the same operation in many different scenarios.</p>
    
    
    <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
    <p>Variable names should be descriptive, so that a human being can tell what the variable is meant to contain and what data type it is likely to be.  hc is just not very descriptive.</p>
    
    <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
    <p>Variables should also be able to be used with mathematical operations.  I am assuming you can also create objects in javascript, and that we will be able to the methods/variables of those objects.  Variables will be useful in assigning objects a handle so that we can interact with it.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
    <p>var declares to Javascript that the word to follow is the name of a variable and not some method or function name.  It's a declaration.</p>
    
    
    <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
    <p>It doesn't alert or write that message to console at all!  An error message does appear in the log screen.  So I suppose that's good in that it didn't throw an error.  But it's a silent way of failing.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p>When do we get to more exciting things?</p>
