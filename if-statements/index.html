    <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
    <p>True and false values are called booleans.</p>
    
    <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
    <p>"true" is just a string spelling the word.  It is not at all equal to the boolean true.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="part-b" style="border: yellow 1px solid">

      <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
      <p>Because I used the ==, yes it has to match exactly in type and content.  But actually since the password is a string and prompt returns a string, the type part is not really relevant.  The biggest issue is that it is case-sensitive.</p>
      
      <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
      <p>You should not use = because that will set the value rather than compare it.  You could use == or === in this case, because, as I mentioned, the password is a string.  If the password was an integer, then == would be better because it would allow </p>
      
      <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
      <p>It's not secure.  It could be easily hacked.</p>

    <div id="part-c" style="border: green 1px solid">

      <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
      <p>Use == because it doesn't take type into consideration.  Or you could parseInt the user's response before you assign it to the variable and use ===.</p>
      <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
      <p>Use you can, as I mentioned above.  If you're going to use the secret number after this, it's definitely helpful to parse it as an integer.</p>
      <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
      <p>== means that they are equivalent to each other but not necessarily of the same type. === means they are equal to each other in value and also the same data type.</p>
      <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
      <p>The advantages to keeping it a string is that it's simpler to read the line and all you're doing is comparing the two.  Also it's more pure, as the parseInt will take off any string the user adds to the end of a number, and they may be able to 'hack' the secret number when it's not intended.</p>
      <p>If you were doing anything else with this secret number (like mathematical operations), I would parse it into an integer.</p>

      <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
      <p>Yes, it matters.  You want to ask the most restrictive one first.</p>
      <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
      <p>I used a case statement with >= and == and a && statement.  && is for both should be true.  You can usually work your statements one way or another.  Neither is better than the other.  Just what is more clear.</p>
      <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
      <p>Strings that can't convert to numbers, but not null.  Yes, I checked for non-numbers by not allowing the user to stop the loop until they entered something that could be parsed as an Integer.  Or you could, as you suggested, check for NaN from the start by having that be the first option.</p>
      <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
      <p>None so far.  But just wait! : )</p>

      <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
      <p>Yes, it still matters which order because of the way in which I have structured the conditionals in my switch statement.  If I had defined them more narrowly, then it would not matter, but there would probably be a more efficient order.</p>
      <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
      <p>It will never be true.</p>
      <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
      <p>Use variables for the conditional statements.  For example:
      </p>
      <p>case (age >= drivingAge):</p>

      <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
      <p>I prevented this from happening but I predict if I do this, it will throw an error and code will be interrupted.  In fact, it doesn't seem to throw an error.</p>
      <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
      <p>If one length or any length is zero, it actually says the triangle is possible, which is a bug.  A while !a when parsed for an Int or a Float does not allow the user to enter 0, which is good to know.</p>
     <h2> What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
      
      <p>No negative number should be able to work because the negative number will be smallest and will overwhelm any attempts to add up to more than the smallest number. All negative numbers will get more negative.  Negative + a positive number is less than the first number.  That part works ok.</p>
